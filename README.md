# pomegranate-nlp-hmm
Udacity project: natural language processing part of speech tagger.

This deviates from the Udacity template in several ways:
1) It downloads the Brown Corpus independantly.
2) It uses pandas instead of helper code for data structure.
3) The functions and variables changed, with corresponding assertions.
4) The pomegranate implementation uses matrix format.

Thank you, Udacity.
